# MIDI Macros

This is a simple application to allow triggering arbritrary actions based on midi key presses.

I found a couple of apps that do something similar, but they all seemed to be paid so I thought I would create one for my own use.

This is also an experiment with AI coding, as this app was completely written by Claude Code.

## Running

(Requires uv installed)

First set up a virtual environment and install dependencies with:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
uv install
```


```shell
python main.py
```
